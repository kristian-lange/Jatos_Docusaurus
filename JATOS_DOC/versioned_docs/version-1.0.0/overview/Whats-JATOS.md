## This is in new version
JATOS (Just Another Tool for Online Studies) helps you set up and run your online studies on your own server.

**New: [MindProbe](https://mindprobe.eu/), a free server for hosting online experiments. Powered by JATOS. Sponsored by the [European Society for Cognitive Psychology (ESCoP)](https://www.escop.eu/) with [Journal of Cognition](https://www.journalofcognition.org/) as their official journal and [OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/).**

**Please complete our short [survey](https://forms.gle/Jtjw4LxpyWVFEtG17) on how (much) you use JATOS (ca. 3 min). It’s very important for us!**

### JATOS at a glance: 
* Run studies on your **own server**. This means that you keep complete control over who can access your result data and can comply with your ethics.
* Studies run on **mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and lab computers** - any device with a browser.
* Use tools like **jsPsych**, **lab.js**, **OSWeb/OpenSesame**, or **PsyToolkit** to prepare your study - or write all **HTML / JavaScript / CSS** yourself and have full control.
* **Run group studies** where multiple workers interact with each other in real-time.
* It’s GUI-based, so there's no need to use the terminal to talk to your server. 
* Recruit participants via **MTurk**, **Prolific** etc.
* It's **open-source and free** to use.
* **Manage workers**, to e.g. make sure that each participant does your study only **once**.
* **Upload** files, e.g. audio or video recordings
* **Export/Import** studies to facilitate exchange with other researchers.
* You can **try out** [JATOS on _cortex_, our test server](JATOS-Tryout-Server.html).
