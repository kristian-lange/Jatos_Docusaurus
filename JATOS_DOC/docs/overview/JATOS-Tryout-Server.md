Cortex is a running JATOS server where you can try out JATOS in the Internet instead of your local computer:

[https://cortex.jatos.org](https://cortex.jatos.org) (log in with _test@jatos.org_ and _abc1234_ or with a Google account)

This is a normal JATOS installation with many example studies already imported (test account only). You can run the examples or import your own studies if you want to test them in a JATOS running in an online environment. 

But be aware that every day **this JATOS server will be reset** to its inital state and **all changes, uploaded experiments and data will be lost**. Additionally, there is only one log-in account that anybody can use, so everybody will be able to see, delete and take your data. In other words, **DO NOT use  this JATOS instance to run your studies online**. It is only there to provide an example JATOS for people to try out.
